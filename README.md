# V2Ray Config Sharing Application

The V2Ray Config Sharing Application allows users to access a list of V2Ray configurations, copy them, and import them into their primary V2Ray application to connect to VPNs. These configurations are gathered from various sources and made available within the application.

## Features

- **Admin Version**: An admin-specific version enables administrators to manage configurations by adding and deleting them using an API. This functionality is achieved via [Retool](https://retool.com/).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A user-friendly version caters to regular users, simplifying the process of copying configurations and connecting to a VPN through a filter.

## Functionality

The application comprises two versions:
- **Admin Version**: Admins can add, delete, and manage configurations using an API connected through Retool.
- **Regular User Version**: Allows regular users to copy configurations hassle-free, eliminating the need to search for various configurations on social media platforms. Users can comfortably utilize different configurations through this application.

## API Integration

The application utilizes Retool's API to facilitate configuration management for admins, streamlining the addition and removal of V2Ray configurations.

## Usage

1. **Admin Version**: Access the admin panel to add or delete configurations.
2. **Regular User Version**: Easily copy desired configurations within the app and import them into the V2Ray application for VPN connectivity.
